2. Write enough to make it pass [commit](https://github.com/donedgardo/GuildInventoryWowAddon/commit/3dec175f4b0aa04ccca6cf5bebf6ed0ccac9de68)
3. Refactor [commit](https://github.com/donedgardo/GuildInventoryWowAddon/commit/e7ce1783dc2ba40959a24d234013ea66378eead9)
4. Fail the test by adding the addItem non-existent method[commit](https://github.com/donedgardo/GuildInventoryWowAddon/commit/f0cd4e5b5d4f6da1c2a8091da9f9ec1b155ad960);

5. Make the test pass by adding the method. [commit](https://github.com/donedgardo/GuildInventoryWowAddon/commit/c12268fd841cf7db1bdd7b725cee97e802c132b9)
6. Refactor? Well it may be premature but I think the signature for addItems should require who is adding the item. 
We can leave this for the next test lets finish up. Ill add this to the list.
7. Failing test on if it added the item or not. [commit]();
